# hello-world
my first repository

I aim to learn more, do more, and live more in programming as well as in life so as to explore and
extend my full potential. I have a studentsâ€™ intent towards innovation and logic development. I can
generate solutions as well as implement them in a program with equal ease. My greatest strength is
my ability to think rationally which enables me to model a problem in the real world and provide a
suitable solution to it.
